# Scraping examples

Below are a few examples of real-world (and a couple not-so-real-world) scrapers we'll be going over in class:

  - *[Gitmo Periodic Review Board scraper](https://github.com/newsdev/nyt-prb-scraper/blob/master/prb/__init__.py)*: We run this on a regular basis to pick up changes in the status of detainees at Guantanamo Bay. It's used in part to ensure our [app](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/guantanamo) remains up-to-date.

  - *[NPR Armslist scraper](https://github.com/nprapps/armslist-scraper)*: Armslist is an online marketplace for firearms, sometimes described as the Craigslist for guns. NPR did several [stories](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/06/17/482483537/semi-automatic-weapons-without-a-background-check-can-be-just-a-click-away) about this, which in part were based on data scraped from the site. They also put together a short [guide](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2016/06/17/scraping-tips.html) describing how they did it â€” and how they [analyzed it later](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/09/02/reusable-data-processing.html).

  - *[Amanda Hickman's scraping examples](https://github.com/amandabee/scraping-for-journalists/blob/master/examples.md): Amanda Hickman, who runs Buzzfeed's Open Lab for Journalism, put together this list of stories where scraping was instrumental to newsgathering. They don't come with code examples, but interesting nonetheless.

  - *[Dan Nguyen's 101 scrapers](https://github.com/stanfordjournalism/search-script-scrape): Kind of the opposite of Amanda's examples, these are 101 simple scrapers that could be useful in journalism but haven't necessarily been used in stories.
