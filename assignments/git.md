Git assignment
=================

You've already created a Github account. Your next task will be to create a repository that you can use to turn in your assignments. This is going to require a bit of command-line navigation, as well as your newfound knowledge of Git.

You can either [create the repo on Github first](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) then clone it to your machine, or create it first on your machine and then [sync it with Github](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/). Whatever you prefer. It should have a name that makes sense, so that I know what I'm looking for when I'm grading your assignments.

Once you have your repo set up, please also add, commit and push a README.md file with a brief introduction of who you are and why you're taking this class! I don't get to see you in person often, and I'd love to learn more about you.
